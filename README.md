## CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS ##
Credit risk represents the likelihood that a borrower may fail to meet their debt obligations, either partially or entirely. Such defaults can lead to significant financial losses for lenders, as they may not recover the principal amount or interest owed. Accurate credit risk assessment is critical to ensuring financial stability and enabling responsible lending practices.

This project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a predictive machine learning models to assess credit risk. By evaluating the probability of borrower defaults, the model empowers financial institutions to make informed lending decisions.
